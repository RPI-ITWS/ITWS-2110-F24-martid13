I created a weather and currency exchange dashboard that dynamically displays current exchange information from Frankfurter and weater data from OpenWeatherMap.

This currency info is fetched using the Frankfurter API and then posted to my mysql database, then fetched back using PHP. I display it 
on my front end as a table displaying the relevant exchange information. For my other APIs, I display the weather information for Troy in a neat box using bootstrap css. I also display a random Upsplash image. 

For creativity, I am using bootstrap css boxes to neatly display my different components, as well as an HTML table I create in my retrieve.php file. I also adjusted my bootstrap css to make my button have a small animation. I also adjusted the margins on my main IDs for a better appearance.
